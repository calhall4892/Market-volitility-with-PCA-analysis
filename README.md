# Market-volitility-with-PCA-analysis

Introduction

Volitiity within a market is described as how much a price moves within a given time period. This can be over any time period. When a stock is more volitile, the price is far more likely to move up and down rather than a stable stock which will have a far more stable price. This is an important metric for investors as a volitile market will be more unstable and therefore riskier, but potentially yield larger returns.
